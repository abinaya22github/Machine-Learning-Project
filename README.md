# Project Title

Credit score classification




 Introduction

In this case study, we explore the application of machine learning techniques to predict credict scores based on a

comprehensive dataset containing various customer attributes and financial information.

The dataset includes features such as customer demographics, income, loan, details, payment behavior, and credit utilization.

By utilizing this data, we aim to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting credit scores for individuals.

The results of this study can assist financial institutions in automating the credit assessment process and improving lending decisions.
